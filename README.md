# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes booking cancellation patterns at two major hotel types — City Hotel and Resort Hotel — using real-world data from 2015 to 2017. With a significant cancellation rate impacting both revenue and room utilization, this analysis aims to uncover insights and propose actionable solutions to minimize cancellations and boost profitability.

## 💼 Business Problem

City Hotel and Resort Hotel are suffering from high cancellation rates, leading to:

* Reduced revenue
* Poor room utilization

### Objective

Reduce booking cancellations and provide strategic business insights to optimize revenue generation.

## 🎯 Assumptions

* No major external events influenced the data between 2015–2017.
* Data is relevant and reflects the hotels' operations accurately.
* Hotels aren't already using our proposed strategies.
* Cancellation is the biggest revenue challenge.
* A canceled booking leads to a vacant room.
* Cancellations and bookings occur in the same year.

## ❓ Research Questions

1. What factors influence hotel booking cancellations?
2. How can cancellation rates be minimized?
3. How can this data help hotels with pricing and promotional decisions?

## 🔬 Hypotheses
